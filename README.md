# React Piano

This is a project demonstrating the WebAudio API. It renders an on-screen keyboard using React, and binds a WebAudio node to each key on key presses.

To test your own copy, fork this repository, install the dependencies with ```npm i```, & run ```npm start```

You can change the host IP & port number the app is served on in 'webpack.config.js',
under the modules.exports.devServer object.
